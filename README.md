# AI Investing 

For my dissertation I created a web application with a focus around beginner investors, to encourage a more robust trading society in the UK. My idea was to educate users new to trading. Therefore providing them with the courage and knowledge to trade. As well as providing them with a reinforcement learning agent to make informed decisions on their behalf. This website was a huge success and can be viewed at https://ai-investing.onrender.com/ however it is only for demonstration purposes and does not involve the trading of any real stocks or shares.
